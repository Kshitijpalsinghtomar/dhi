# DHI-v1 Live Workspace

**Last updated:** 2026-11-02  
**Repository:** https://github.com/Kshitijpalsinghtomar/dhi  
**Branch:** `main`  
**Live-state rule:** This file is the first read at every session. It supersedes older chat summaries and dated handover snapshots when describing current status.

## 1. Identity

- Active programme: **DHI-v1 — Predictive Agentic Intelligence**.
- Model codename used in this programme: **ORBIT**.
- DHI-v0 is historical and separate.
- GBA/DPAK and all other research are separate. Do not mix evidence or directions across projects without a committed DHI decision.
- GitHub is the durable project memory. Follow [the Git-first workflow](docs/12_GIT_FIRST_WORKFLOW.md).

## 2. Current objective

Develop a model whose learned capabilities support goal/constraint reasoning, dynamic tool discovery and affordance-aware selection, hierarchical long-horizon planning, action-effect prediction, feedback-conditioned replanning, safe execution, context continuity, and independently verified goal closure.

This is a research target, not a result or novelty claim. A prompt, RAG store, fixed router, scripted client, or external orchestrator is not by itself the learned model contribution.

## 3. Current phase and status

  The 120-task base screen is now defined as Stage A, nested in a 240-task
  ten-stratum panel with a held-out Stage B. Task instances, executable
  coverage, model-comparable inference access, and verified trajectory data
  remain incomplete.

**No DHI-v1 model capability result is currently established. No DHI-v1 SFT, DPO, RL, or custom latent-predictive training run is authorized.**

## 4. What is implemented

- Deterministic file-workspace environment and pinned SHA-256 fixture.
- Bounded model-to-tool runner with per-turn tool-schema refresh.
- Adaption Responses API adapter and hosted-model catalogue reader.
- Read-only Adaption connector-catalogue discovery.
- Twelve hand-authored diagnostic seeds: eight common executable cases, one Adaption-specific discovery case, and three unsupported future-runtime cases.
- Observable grader for tool use, no-tool restraint, recovery, state changes, protected paths, and verified closure.
- Model-facing entrypoints:
  - `python -m DHI_v1.benchmark.run_model_pilot`
  - `python -m DHI_v1.benchmark.run_pilot_benchmark`

## 5. Evidence ledger

| Item | Status | Evidence boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Scripted reference pilot | 8/8 passed | Harness/reference validation only; not an LLM result or training data |
| Historical environment/benchmark tests | 75 passed on 2026-10-31 | Historical run; do not claim latest HEAD is tested |
| ORBIT adjudication gate | Focused tests passed on 2026-10-31 | Gate code verification only |
| INFER-001 hosted inference preflight | Hosted catalogue succeeded; Responses inference not run | Only Gemma 4 31B matches a selected candidate in the hosted catalogue; Qwen/GPT-OSS base comparison unavailable through that route |
| ADAPTION-001 live platform audit | Completed; read-only | Qwen/Gemma require 10,000 effective training rows; GPT-OSS recipe returned for 300 rows; dataset not eligible; zero credits spent |
| Untouched candidate model screening | Not run | No model winner |
| DHI-v1 executed model trajectories | None recorded | No trajectory SFT source yet |
| DHI-v1 training | Not authorized / not run | Data and benchmark gates remain closed |

## 6. Data status and hard stops

- Both 120-row Invent task-spec candidates are quarantined because task-contract JSON was generated as a completion rather than a natural answer/valid execution trajectory.
- The 300-row ORBIT collaboration-behaviour candidate (`169af31f-06e0-4a48-84ab-b84c9f9ce924`) is Invent-sourced and not training-ready: only 98 visible complete pairs were reviewed (25 candidate, 53 revise, 20 reject); 202 rows remain unreviewed. This was model-assisted partial triage, not full independent adjudication.
- Adaption's evaluation of that dataset returned grade A / 9.4 on a 100-row evaluation sample. This is text-quality metadata, not an agent-capability score and not evidence of executed tool traces.
- Live Adaption recommendations confirmed a 10,000-effective-row minimum for Qwen3.6-35B-A3B and Gemma 4 31B. GPT-OSS-20B returned a LoRA recipe for the 300-row set, but this does not override its provenance/review failure.
- Do not train on any of those datasets, do not promote their Adaption grades to capability evidence, and do not fabricate tool traces or outcomes.
- The primary future SFT evidence must be actual model execution in the DHI environment, with raw tool responses, actual state deltas, predictions, and independently verified postconditions.
- Do not spend Adaption credits until the documented data, benchmark, model, and estimate gates pass.

## 7. Current blockers and platform boundary

The previous hosted-model catalogue preflight is complete. The connected Adaption MCP integration is useful for training-registry inspection, dataset inventory/evaluation, data transformation estimates, hyperparameter recommendations, and AutoScientist runs. It does **not** expose the hosted Responses inference operation.

Current facts:
- Live training registry lists Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B, openai/gpt-oss-20b, and google/gemma-4-31B-it for supported SFT/DPO methods.
- The separate hosted Responses catalogue returned six IDs, but only Gemma 4 31B matched a committed candidate. Qwen3.6 and GPT-OSS were absent from that hosted catalogue. Do not treat registry support as inference access.
- A single Gemma call would test only one integration path; it cannot select the primary model against the mandatory GPT-OSS challenger. It is therefore not the next research action.
- The live Adaption recommender rejected Qwen3.6 and Gemma on the 300-row dataset because they require at least 10,000 effective rows. GPT-OSS returned a recipe, but the dataset remains ineligible.
- The recommender did not return a price quote. Dataset generation/adaptation/augmentation actions expose `estimate: true`; the connected training-launch action spends credits and has no estimate field in its exposed schema. Obtain platform cost information before any chargeable launch.
- No DHI-v1 inference, training run, or new dataset-generation job was launched in ADAPTION-001. Credits spent: zero.

Experiment records:
- `DHI_v1/experiments/INFER-001/` — secure runtime and hosted catalogue preflight.
- `DHI_v1/experiments/ADAPTION-001/` — live Adaption model/data eligibility audit.

## 8. Active verification

VERIFY-001 is blocked on Deepnote's parallel-project quota. Initial run `93645a78-7cd2-4c64-9c84-353fbd31e15c` verified the exact checkout and passed compileall; pytest did not collect tests because pytest was missing. The retry cell (`f0d38652cb8c490595ca474cc5ae2317`) is ready but both detached and live run creation were rejected before execution by the same quota. Machine inspection found one project currently running in the workspace; no project was stopped. Experiment record: `DHI_v1/experiments/VERIFY-001/`.

## 9. Next authorized action

**Materialize the two benchmark partitions and map executable coverage before any model run.**

The scope relationship is now resolved and committed:
- [Controlling allocation](benchmark/SCREEN_AND_DIAGNOSTIC_SCOPE.md): Stage A = 120 tasks (12 per each of ten strata); Stage B = 120 additional held-out tasks (12 per stratum); complete panel = 240 unique tasks.
- [Model-selection protocol](docs/03_MODEL_SELECTION_AND_ADAPTION.md), Section 5, and [benchmark protocol](docs/05_BENCHMARK_PROTOCOL.md), Section 3, now use the same allocation.
- [Decision log](docs/07_DECISIONS_AND_RESEARCH_LOG.md) records why the earlier 6×20 split was replaced.

Next:
1. Create a task manifest/schema with explicit stratum, stage, task-family, environment, required tools, postconditions, grader, and split metadata.
2. Map each of the ten strata to actual environment capabilities and executable/independently checkable graders. Current file-workspace pilot does not support all required strata; record those as harness gaps.
3. Build Stage A and Stage B from distinct task families and hash the partitions before comparing models. Exclude the existing 12-case integration pilot from both.
4. Resolve comparable untouched-base inference access for Qwen3.6-35B-A3B and GPT-OSS-20B. Gemma 4 31B remains the optional multimodal challenger; do not treat its hosted availability as a substitute for the mandatory Qwen-vs-GPT-OSS comparison.
5. Build actual environment-executed trajectories only after a valid baseline route is available. Do not use the partially reviewed 300-row Invent dataset as a replacement.
6. Keep Adaption spending gated by valid data provenance, model-specific eligibility and estimates/cost confirmation.

VERIFY-001 remains blocked by Deepnote's parallel-project quota. No project has been stopped. No benchmark tasks were generated or run by the scope decision; no model was run and no Adaption credits were spent.

The current version of this file is the active checkpoint. Its own commit SHA is the newest `main` commit when this file is fetched; always inspect the branch head rather than hardcoding a self-referential SHA here.

## 11. Session continuation checklist

A new agent must:
1. Read this file.
2. Fetch the latest `main` head and inspect changes since the last checkpoint.
3. Read [the Git-first workflow](docs/12_GIT_FIRST_WORKFLOW.md).
4. Read the controlling plan and the exact protocol for the next task.
5. Verify the latest run/experiment from its raw artifact reference—not from a chat message.
6. Continue only the single next authorized action above.
7. Commit every meaningful checkpoint, including failures and blockers, then update this workspace before switching tasks.

Do not use this chat as a handover. The repository must remain sufficient to resume the work.
