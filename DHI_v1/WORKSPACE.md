# DHI-v1 Live Workspace

**Last updated:** 2026-11-02  
**Repository:** https://github.com/Kshitijpalsinghtomar/dhi  
**Branch:** `main`  
**Live-state rule:** This file is the first read at every session. It supersedes older chat summaries and dated handover snapshots when describing current status.

## 1. Identity

- Active programme: **DHI-v1 — Predictive Agentic Intelligence**.
- Model codename used in this programme: **ORBIT**.
- DHI-v0 is historical and separate.
- GBA/DPAK and all other research are separate. Do not mix evidence or directions across projects without a committed DHI decision.
- GitHub is the durable project memory. Follow [the Git-first workflow](docs/12_GIT_FIRST_WORKFLOW.md).

## 2. Current objective

Develop a model whose learned capabilities support goal/constraint reasoning, dynamic tool discovery and affordance-aware selection, hierarchical long-horizon planning, action-effect prediction, feedback-conditioned replanning, safe execution, context continuity, and independently verified goal closure.

This is a research target, not a result or novelty claim. A prompt, RAG store, fixed router, scripted client, or external orchestrator is not by itself the learned model contribution.

## 3. Current phase and status

<details>
<summary>Machine-readable status</summary>

```yaml

status_reason: >
  The model-facing runner and Adaption Responses adapter are implemented,
  but this workspace has no verified account-hosted inference model ID or
  credentialed live inference result.

**No DHI-v1 model capability result is currently established. No DHI-v1 SFT, DPO, RL, or custom latent-predictive training run is authorized.**

## 4. What is implemented

- Deterministic file-workspace environment and pinned SHA-256 fixture.
- Bounded model-to-tool runner with per-turn tool-schema refresh.
- Adaption Responses API adapter and hosted-model catalogue reader.
- Read-only Adaption connector-catalogue discovery.
- Twelve hand-authored diagnostic seeds: eight common executable cases, one Adaption-specific discovery case, and three unsupported future-runtime cases.
- Observable grader for tool use, no-tool restraint, recovery, state changes, protected paths, and verified closure.
- Model-facing entrypoints:
  - `python -m DHI_v1.benchmark.run_model_pilot`
  - `python -m DHI_v1.benchmark.run_pilot_benchmark`

## 5. Evidence ledger

| Item | Status | Evidence boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Scripted reference pilot | 8/8 passed | Harness/reference validation only; not an LLM result or training data |
| Historical environment/benchmark tests | 75 passed on 2026-10-31 | Historical run; do not claim latest HEAD is tested |
| ORBIT adjudication gate | Focused tests passed on 2026-10-31 | Gate code verification only |
| Untouched candidate model screening | Not run | No model winner |
| DHI-v1 executed model trajectories | None recorded | No trajectory SFT source yet |
| DHI-v1 training | Not authorized / not run | Data and benchmark gates remain closed |

## 6. Data status and hard stops

- Both 120-row Invent task-spec candidates are quarantined because task-contract JSON was generated as a completion rather than a natural answer/valid execution trajectory.
- The 300-row ORBIT collaboration-behaviour candidate is not training-ready: only 98 visible complete pairs were reviewed (25 candidate, 53 revise, 20 reject); 202 rows remain unreviewed. This was model-assisted partial triage, not full independent adjudication.
- Do not train on any of those datasets, do not promote their Adaption grades to capability evidence, and do not fabricate tool traces or outcomes.
- The primary future SFT evidence must be actual model execution in the DHI environment, with raw tool responses, actual state deltas, predictions, and independently verified postconditions.
- Do not spend Adaption credits until the documented data, benchmark, model, and estimate gates pass.

## 7. Exact current blocker

The code path is available, but no live hosted inference call has been verified from this workspace.

Adaption flow documented in the repository:
1. Use an API key through a secure runtime/local secret (never store it in Git or chat).
2. Run `python -m DHI_v1.environment.examples.list_adaption_models` to obtain the exact account-visible hosted IDs from `GET /api/v1/models?type=hosted`.
3. Select an ID actually returned by that endpoint; do not assume the training-registry ID is callable.
4. Only after model ID/access and user-approved provider/cost are confirmed, run the development pilot with `DHI_MODEL_PROVIDER=adaption` and `DHI_MODEL_NAME=<exact-hosted-id>`.
5. Preserve the report and per-case traces; label this as a development pilot, not a frozen benchmark or training data.

The connected Adaption MCP actions available during the latest repository review did not expose the hosted Responses inference method. No credential is recorded in Git. Do not ask the user to paste a key into chat.

## 8. Next authorized action

**Resolve the hosted inference preflight without changing the research design.**

- Inspect the current Adaption account's available hosted model IDs through the documented authenticated endpoint using a secure runtime secret.
- If an exact supported ID is available, record the model ID, provider route, date, and access result here before running anything.
- If access is unavailable, record the precise error and leave the model benchmark blocked. Do not silently switch provider, guess a model ID, train, or generate another dataset.

Before a confirmatory base-screen design, reconcile the repository's scope discrepancy: the model-selection document describes a 120-task initial screen (6×20), while the benchmark protocol describes a 240-task diagnostic suite (10×24). The existing 12-case development pilot is neither. Record the intended staged design in the decision log before freezing a larger suite.

The current version of this file is the active checkpoint. Its own commit SHA is the newest `main` commit when this file is fetched; always inspect the branch head rather than hardcoding a self-referential SHA here.

## 10. Session continuation checklist

A new agent must:
1. Read this file.
2. Fetch the latest `main` head and inspect changes since the last checkpoint.
3. Read [the Git-first workflow](docs/12_GIT_FIRST_WORKFLOW.md).
4. Read the controlling plan and the exact protocol for the next task.
5. Verify the latest run/experiment from its raw artifact reference—not from a chat message.
6. Continue only the single next authorized action above.
7. Commit every meaningful checkpoint, including failures and blockers, then update this workspace before switching tasks.

Do not use this chat as a handover. The repository must remain sufficient to resume the work.
